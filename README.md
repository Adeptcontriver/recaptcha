Random number calculation by this formula ((number1 * number2) \ (number3 - number4 )) . 
The answer must be Positive and integer
Approach:
Solve this scenario through the Do While loop. In this, I've just passed the Variable and then assigned the random value by using the PHP Rand Function and calculating the equation.
The result of the calculation is stored in the new variable. Then in the while, I have echo my Equations Statements.
